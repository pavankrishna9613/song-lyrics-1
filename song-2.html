    Thought I found a way
    Thought I found a way out (found)
    But you never go away (never go away)
    So I guess I gotta stay now
    Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
    Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
    Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
    Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
    Isn't it lovely? All alone
    Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
    Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
    Hello, welcome home
    Walking out of town
    Looking for a better place (looking for a better place)
    Something's on my mind
    Always in my head space
    But I know someday I'll make it out of here
    Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
    Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
    Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
    Isn't it lovely? All alone
    Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
    Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
    Hello, welcome home
    Woah, yeah
    Yeah, ah
    Woah, woah
    Hello, welcome home
